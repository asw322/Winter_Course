## Assignments & Grading
Checkpoint 1           33%
Checkpoint 2           33%
Checkpoint 3           33%

This is short but dense academic term, and we have created a project to reflect this reality. The only deliverable will be a group project, with 3 separate sprints as checkpoints (check the schedule section for due dates). Each sprint will account for 1/3 of your final grade. 

As a 0 credit course, you will still be given a grade (A/B/C/etc) that will appear on your transcript, even if it does not impact your overall GPA. This course is entirely for your own personal benefit, and we do not want grades to be a worry for you, but we still expect effort from everyone. 

We will utilize the standard Lehigh grade cutoffs for determining grades:
    A   : > 93
    A-  : > 90
    B+  : > 87
    etc

We reserve the right to change the cutoffs in your favor to more accurately describe your effort and the final product in this course. Talk to your TA individually if you have any concerns about grading.


## Academic Integrity
PLEASE READ: Just because this is a 0 credit class does not mean that Academic Integrity goes out the window. You are still expected to follow all Academic Integrity policies as you would in any other class. If you have questions about this policy at any point throughout the semester, ask. 

Lehigh University Undergraduate Student Senate Statement on Academic Integrity

“We, the Lehigh University Student Senate, as the standing representative body of all undergraduates, reaffirm the duty & obligation of students to meet & uphold the highest principles & values of personal, moral & ethical conduct. As partners in our educational community, both students & faculty share the responsibility for promoting & helping to ensure an environment of academic integrity. As such, each student is expected to complete all academic course work in accordance to the standards set forth by the faculty & in compliance with the University's Code of Conduct.”


Winter Course Specific Academic Integrity Rules
    - In this class, you will work in a team and you will need to search the Internet to problem solve. However, copying and pasting code you don't understand, or large sections of code, is prohibited.
    - You should not:
        - Ask for help from anyone outside of your team, except for the Professor and TA
        - Copy anything verbatim from the Internet
        - Share your work with other teams, nor should you ask for work from other teams.
    - All work that you submit must be entirely your own, and if asked, you should be able to explain every detail of it. 
    - Use your best judgement. If you think what you are doing is unethical, it probably is.


## Accomodations for Students with Disabilities 
Lehigh University is committed to maintaining an equitable and inclusive community and welcomes students with disabilities into all of the University’s educational programs. In order to receive consideration for reasonable accommodations, a student with a disability must contact Disability Support Services (DSS), provide documentation, and participate in an interactive review process. If the documentation supports a request for reasonable accommodations, DSS will provide students with a Letter of Accommodations. Students who are approved for accommodations at Lehigh should share this letter and discuss their accommodations and learning needs with instructors as early in the semester as possible. For more information or to request services, please contact Disability Support Services in person in Williams Hall, Suite 301, via phone at 610-758-4152, via email at ​indss@lehigh.edu​, or online at ​https://studentaffairs.lehigh.edu/disabilities​.


# The Principles of Our Equitable Community
Lehigh University endorses ​The Principles of Our Equitable Community​. We expect each member of this class to acknowledge and practice these Principles. Respect for each other and for differing viewpoints is a vital component of the learning environment inside and outside the classroom.
